# Microservices REST API with Serverless Framework, AWS, and Node.js

In this project, we’ll build a robust and scalable microservices-based REST API using the Serverless Framework, AWS services, and Node.js. Our goal is to create a flexible architecture that allows for easy deployment, efficient scaling, and seamless integration with other services.

### Key Components:

1. Serverless Framework: We’ll leverage the Serverless Framework to define our infrastructure as code (IaC). This framework simplifies the process of deploying serverless microservices by managing AWS resources, such as Lambda functions.

2. Microservices Architecture: Our API will be broken down into smaller, independent microservices. Each microservice will handle a specific functionality, promoting modularity and maintainability.

3. Node.js: We’ll use Node.js for our backend logic. Node.js is well-suited for serverless applications due to its asynchronous nature and lightweight footprint.

4. RESTful API Design: We’ll design our API endpoints following RESTful principles. This ensures clear communication between clients and services, making it easier to consume and maintain.

5. AWS Services:

   - AWS Lambda: Our microservices will run as Lambda functions, allowing us to execute code without managing servers.

   - Amazon API Gateway: We’ll create RESTful endpoints using API Gateway, enabling secure access to our services.

   - Amazon DynamoDB: For data storage, we’ll use DynamoDB, a fully managed NoSQL database.

   - AWS IAM: We’ll configure fine-grained permissions using Identity and Access Management (IAM) roles.

   - AWS CloudFormation: We’ll use CloudFormation to model and provision our AWS resources, such as VPCs, policies, DynamoDB tables, and REST API Gateways. It is also used by the Serverless Framework under the hood to provision our Lambda functions and other AWS resources.
